"JUNO sensitivity to 7Be, pep, and CNO neutrinos"
Macro to generate Figure 12: "Relative uncertainty of 13N (left panel) and 15O (right panel) neutrino rates as a function of exposure. The solid lines refer to the fit configurations where all the species have been left free to vary, while the dashed lines to the configuration where the rate of pep neutrinos has been constrained."
