"JUNO sensitivity to 7Be, pep, and CNO neutrinos"
Macro to generate Figure 5: "Correlation plots obtained from the sensitivity study, performing 10^4 fits in the baseline radiopurity scenario for six years of data taking. The red histograms display the distributions of the best-fit reconstructed rates, expressed in cpd/kton units. The non-diagonal frames report the correlation plots among the different species."
