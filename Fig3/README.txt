"JUNO sensitivity to 7Be, pep, and CNO neutrinos"
Macro to generate Figure 3: "Examples of simulated energy spectra employed for the sensitivity analysis, for six year data taking. The different solid lines correspond to the four analyzed radiopurity scenarios: IBD (purple line), baseline (blue line), ideal (light blue line), and Borexino-like (green line). The TFC-subtracted and TFC-tagged datasets are reported in the left and right panels. The 7Be, pep, 13N, and 15O neutrino contributions are shown as red, orange, pink, and yellow ticker solid lines, respectively."
