The pyROOT macro Solarnu.py (with comments) creates the plot of Energy spectra of solar neutrinos from the pp chain (solid lines) and CNO cycle (dashed lines).
The spectral shapes are taken from http://www.sns.ias.edu/∼jnb/ and flux normalization (as scale_f from the HZ-SSM predictions given in N. Vinyoles, A.M. Serenelli, F.L. Villante, S. Basu, J. Bergström, M.C. Gonzalez-Garcia et al.,779, A New Generation of Standard Solar Models, Astrophys. J. 835 (2017).
The flux (vertical scale) is given in units of cm^−2s^−1MeV^−1 for continuum sources and in cm^−2s^−1 for monoenergetic sources
This macro creates a .root file and a .eps file as outputs without neutrino color labels and without the predicted flux errors. A .odp format slide has been used to write the neutrino color labels and the predicted flux errors.
