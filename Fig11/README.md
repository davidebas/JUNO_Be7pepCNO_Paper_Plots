This macro produces the 2D plot represeting the uncertainty on the CNO neutrinos rate (scaled for TP = 0.9 and SE = 0.7) as a function of the Tagging Power (TP) and the Subtracted Exposure (SE), in the ideal radiopurity scenario.
This macro takes in input the file "ratio_CNO_ideal.txt". It contains three columns: the first one represents the SE value, the second one the TP value and the third one the CNO uncertainty scaled for the CNO uncertainty when TP = 0.9 and SE = 0.7.
